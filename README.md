# Geographic Data Analysis 🌎

A paid data analysis project I completed on Upwork. I did this as part of a long-term tutoring project. I lead the client through this data analysis and used it to teach him how to use pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn among other libraries. 

It was a two-part project that consisted of weekly calls and lead to the following ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ reviews:

# This Repo is a Work-in-Progress 🏗

I finished this project in August 2020 and have been kept busy with other projects since then. Now, I am in the process of tidying everything up so it can be presented to the world in a nice manner. You are one of the lucky souls who gets to see the repo in its raw form. But this means that not everything is as clean or orderly as it should be.

However, I hope it gives you an idea of how I approached this project and demonstrates my python data analysis skills.

# Libraries Used 📚
