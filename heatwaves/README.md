# Heatwave Analysis

Here we analysesd the heatwaves that occurred, grouped them by region and plotted them. 

You can see the plots in the [`analysis_by_region`](https://github.com/theadammurphy/geographic_data_analysis/tree/main/heatwaves/analysis_by_region) dir above. For space reasons, I've just included a sample. In reality, we analyzed 34 regions of the world. 

You'll note that the plots are messy and have gaps. Thanks to this analysis, we realised the data was not as clean as we originally thought! After re-tracing our steps, we realised these errors were caused by the client during their data collection process (and not something I had done with him in the interim). To solve this, the client went back, re-did his data collection and you can see the final plots in
