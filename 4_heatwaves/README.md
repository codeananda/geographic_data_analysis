# Heatwave Analysis ðŸ¥µ

Here we analysesd the heatwaves that occurred, grouped them by region and plotted them. 

You can see the plots in [`analysis_by_region`](https://github.com/theadammurphy/geographic_data_analysis/tree/main/heatwaves/analysis_by_region) above. For space reasons, I've just included a sample. In reality, we analyzed 34 regions.

You'll note that the plots are messy and have gaps. Thanks to this analysis, we realised the data was not as clean as we originally thought! After re-tracing our steps, we figured out these errors were caused by the client during their data collection process (and not something I had done with him in the interim). 

Once my client re-did thier data collection, we were able to create the [`final_plots`](https://github.com/theadammurphy/geographic_data_analysis/tree/main/final_plots).
