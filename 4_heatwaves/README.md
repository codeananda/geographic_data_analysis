# Heatwave Analysis ðŸ¥µ

Here we analysesd the heatwaves that occurred, grouped them by region and plotted them. 

You can see the plots in [`analysis_by_region`](https://github.com/theadammurphy/geographic_data_analysis/tree/main/heatwaves/analysis_by_region) above. For space reasons, I've just included a sample. In reality, we analyzed 34 regions.

You'll note that the plots are messy and have gaps. **Thanks to this analysis, we realised the data was not as clean as we originally thought!** After re-tracing our steps, we figured out these errors were caused by the client during their data collection process (and not something I had done with him in the interim). 

Once my client re-did thier data collection, we were able to create the [`final_plots`](https://github.com/theadammurphy/geographic_data_analysis/tree/main/final_plots).
